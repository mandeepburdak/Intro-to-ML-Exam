# Introduction to Machine Learning Project: Exploring Data Insights and Business Implications
Our project, undertaken as part of the Introduction to Machine Learning course, is a collaborative endeavor that showcases our journey in applying statistical models and leveraging machine learning concepts to uncover valuable patterns within a diverse range of data.
# Project Overview
Throughout the project, we explored different types of questions and problems, each member delving into distinct facets of the data analysis process. By applying the statistical and machine learning techniques learned during our course, we aimed to not only answer critical questions but also relate our findings to real-world business contexts. Our team consists of the following members:
  1. Mansi Sharma (EID: ms89743)
  2. Krittika Deshwal (EID: kd29275)
  3. Mandeep Burdak (EID: msb4384)
