```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
g_raw = read.csv("/Users/mandeep/Documents/GitHub/STA380/data/groceries.txt",header=FALSE)
long_df <- g_raw %>%
  mutate(cart_id = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("V"), names_to = "item_position", values_to = "item_name") %>%
  arrange(cart_id, as.numeric(gsub("V", "", item_position))) %>%
  select(-item_position)

x=long_df$item_name != ""
long_df<-subset(long_df,x)
```


### Let's take a look at the summary of the grocery carts

```{r, echo=FALSE}
playtrans = as(split(long_df$item_name, long_df$cart_id), "transactions")
summary(playtrans)
```
Whole milk and Other Vegetables seems to be the most common items in people's carts.


```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
musicrules = apriori(playtrans, 
	parameter=list(support=.005, confidence=.1, maxlen=4))
```

### Let's find some association rules, since the dataset is small, let's be lax with our threshold.Let's take the thresholds at 0.5% support, 10% confidence, and a max length of 4


### We found 118 rules, let's take a look at the strongest ones with lift atleast at 3
```{r, echo=FALSE}
inspect(subset(musicrules, lift > 3))
```

## Inference
### The first set of people (rule 1-4) seem to be buying Onion, Veggies and Beef for dinner
### The next set seems to be buying Fruits in bulk
### Interestingly Whole milk does not appear in these strongest of rules.


```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
playlists_graph = associations2igraph(subset(musicrules, lift>1), associationsAsNodes = FALSE)
igraph::write_graph(playlists_graph, file='groceries.graphml', format = "graphml")
```

### Let's try to plot our network now

### Whole Milk appears in a lot of rules, more than any other item, but the rules do not seem to be that strong.
